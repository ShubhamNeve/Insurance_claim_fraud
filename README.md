&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Insurance is an integral component of society and must be affordable
and reliable to provide everyone with aid in time of need. However,
insurance fraud brings disturbance to the insurance sector, increasing the
cost for both insurers and the insured. Frauds in Insurance has been around
since the inception of Insurance organizations. Different types of insurance
are prone to different types of frauds/crimes, however, in most cases, it
manifests deliberate damage to the insured person/item for the purpose to
obtain claims from the insurance provider. This could be a white lie on an
insurance application, an exaggerated claim for damages or injuries, or even
a claim that is blatantly false.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The traditional approach of detecting such frauds is still being used by
few insurers which require human interventions. Some of the traditional
methods are internal audits, red flag indicators, and scoring models.
Detecting insurance fraud and the losses can be difficult since not
every claim can be investigated thoroughly. Hence, the portion of
fraudulent claims that are detected is smaller than that of the portion of
fraudulent acts that are committed.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dataset used for model training and evaluation contains only
24.7% fraudulent claims compared to 75.3% of non-fraudulent claims.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The project has attempted to identify such fraudulent claims with
help of historical data. fraud detection is a knowledge-intensive activity
that allows classifying correctly whether the claim is legitimate or
fraudulent. The project would help to make it easier for human agents to
investigate a fraudulent claim.

An auto insurance is a policy purchased by vehicle owners to mitigate
costs associated with getting into an auto accident. Instead of paying out of
pocket for auto accidents, people pay annual premiums to an auto insurance
company. the company then pays all or most of the costs associated with an
auto accident or other vehicle damage.
